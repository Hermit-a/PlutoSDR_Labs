# PlutoSDR_Labs
Hands on labs for the ADALM Pluto SDR

1.  Getting Started with Pluto IIOscope edition walks through an unboxing of Pluto and using the IIO Oscilloscope tool.  IIO Oscilloscope is built on the libIIO linux drivers, and is a great gateway into prototyping with any of Analog Devices Wideband Tranceivers (i.e. AD9361, AD9371, ADRV9009, etc.)

2.  Getting Started with Pluto GNUradio Edition walks through an unboxing of Pluto using the free GNUradio program.  GNUradio Companion is a little like Matlab Simulink in that it provides a graphical tool kit for many SDR functions (modulation/demoddulation, filtering, interpolation, etc.).  This Getting Started guide demonstrates how to install GNUradio (either on Windows or Linux) and then how to install the Pluto plug in for GNUradio.  From there, two labs are given as examples of how to use Pluto and GNUradio.
    2.1.  Pluto_AM_to_FM.grc is a GNUradio file for the first lab:  Play an AM radio station on an FM radio
    2.2.  Pluto_315MHz_OOK.grc isa  GNUradio file for the second lab:  Hack a wireless device
